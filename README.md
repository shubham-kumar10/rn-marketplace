```

## Design System

The application implements Atomic Design principles, organizing components into a hierarchical structure:

### 1. Atoms (Basic Building Blocks)
- Buttons
- Text inputs
- Icons
- Typography

```typescript
// design-system/atoms/Button.tsx
const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant,
  size,
  children,
  ...props
}) => {
  // Button implementation
};
```

### 2. Molecules (Simple Compositions)
- Form groups
- Search bars
- Navigation headers

### 3. Organisms (Complex Components)
- Product cards
- Shopping cart items
- Category listings

### Benefits
- Consistent design language
- Reusable components
- Maintainable codebase
- Easy component testing

## State Management & Caching

### Search Implementation with Caching
```typescript
// store/slices/search/searchSlice.ts
interface SearchState {
  cache: {
    [query: string]: {
      results: Product[];
      timestamp: number;
    };
  };
  recentSearches: string[];
}

// Caching mechanism
const searchProducts = async (query: string) => {
  const results = await api.search(query);
  cache[query] = {
    results,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };
  return results;
};
```

### Key Features
- Query caching
- Debounced search

## Technical Stack

### Core Dependencies
```json
{
  "@react-navigation/native": "^6.x.x",    // Navigation management
  "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.x.x",           // State management
  "react-native-fast-image": "^8.x.x",    // Optimized image loading
  "@sentry/react-native": "^5.x.x",       // Error tracking
  "react-native-vector-icons": "^9.x.x",  // Icon system
}
```

## Production-Ready Features

### 1. Deep Linking Implementation
```typescript
// navigation/linking.ts
export const linking = {
  prefixes: ['marketplace://', 'https://marketplace.example.com'],
  config: {
    screens: {
      ProductDetails: 'product/:id',
      Category: 'category/:slug',
      Search: 'search',
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Analytics Integration
- Event tracking system for user interactions
- Custom event definitions for business metrics
- Screen view tracking
- Performance monitoring

```typescript
// packages/analytics/analytics.ts
class Analytics {
  static trackEvent(event: string, properties: object) {
    // Event tracking implementation
  }

  static trackScreenView(screen: string) {
    // Screen view tracking
  }

  static trackUserAction(action: string) {
    // User action tracking
  }
}
```

### 3. Error Logging & Monitoring
- Integration with Sentry for error tracking
- Custom error boundaries
- Performance monitoring
- Network error handling

```typescript
// packages/logging/logging.ts
class ErrorTracker {
  static captureException(error: Error) {
    // Error capture implementation
  }

  static trackPerformance(metric: string) {
    // Performance tracking
  }
}
```

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit for centralized state
- RTK Query for API cache management
- Custom hooks for state access

### Navigation
- React Navigation for routing
- Deep linking support
- Type-safe navigation

### Testing & Development
- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library
- TypeScript for type safety

## Performance Optimizations

1. Image Loading
- Fast Image for caching
- Lazy loading
- Placeholder images

2. State Management
- Normalized store structure
- Memoized selectors
- Optimized re-renders

3. List Rendering
- FlatList optimization
- Window-based rendering
- Item memoization

## Future Enhancements

1. Performance
- Implement offline support
- Add image optimization
- Enhance caching strategy  with invalidation

2. Features
- User authentication
- Payment integration
- Push notifications

3. Testing
- Add E2E tests
- Increase test coverage
- Add performance testing

## Conclusion

This architecture demonstrates production-ready implementation with:
- Scalable folder structure
- Real-world feature implementation
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations
- Maintainable codebase
- Testing strategy

The application serves as a solid foundation for an enterprise-level React Native project, incorporating best practices and real-world solutions.



This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
